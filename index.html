		<h3>Welcome</h3>

		<p>Dear Friend,</p>

		<p>
			welcome to my working in progress garden. My idea is to host my personal
			notes about programming, electronics, mechanics and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm writing these personal notes during my spare time just for passion,
			this work is not support by any organization or group, it is my own work.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope that it is of some interest to you, if so consider to donate
			and support me with a coffee ;) on my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/tanozori" target="_blank">Ko-fi Tano Zori Page</a>.

			<script>
			  kofiWidgetOverlay.draw('tanozori', {
			    'type': 'floating-chat',
			    'floating-chat.donateButton.text': 'Support me',
			    'floating-chat.donateButton.background-color': '#00b9fe',
			    'floating-chat.donateButton.text-color': '#fff'
			  });
			</script>
